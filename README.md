## Installation

### Skills (automatic via npx)

```bash
npx skills add b1tank/skills
```

This installs all skills from `skills/` to `~/.copilot/skills/`.

### Agents & Prompts (manual sync)

Use the sync script to copy agents and prompts to a target repo:

```bash
./sync.sh <target-repo-path>
```

Example:
```bash
./sync.sh ~/my-project
```

This copies:
- `agents/*.agent.md` → `<target>/.github/agents/`
- `prompts/*.prompt.md` → `<target>/.github/prompts/`

## Creating New Skills

1. Copy `template/SKILL.md` to `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
2. Update the YAML frontmatter (name, description)
3. Write the skill instructions
4. Push to GitHub
5. Install: `npx skills add b1tank/skills`
