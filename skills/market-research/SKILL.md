# Market Research

Research existing products/competitors to inform product decisions.

## When to Use

- Starting a new project and want to understand the landscape
- Cloning or improving upon an existing product
- Identifying gaps or differentiation opportunities
- Validating product direction against alternatives

## Process

1. **Identify targets**: List 3-5 existing products in the space
2. **Feature analysis**: Document core features of each product
3. **Gap analysis**: Identify what's missing or underserved
4. **Differentiation**: Suggest unique value propositions
5. **Summarize findings** for product decision-making

## Research Areas

For each competitor/reference product:
- **Core features**: What does it do well?
- **Target audience**: Who uses it?
- **Pricing model**: Free/paid/freemium?
- **Technical approach**: Open source? What stack?
- **UX patterns**: What's the user experience like?
- **Limitations**: What are users complaining about?
